Costify Pro - Complete Codebase Analysis Summary

Overview

Costify Pro is a sophisticated food costing and catering management web application built for restaurants, caterers, or food service businesses to calculate and manage pricing with dynamic markup capabilities.

Technology Stack

Framework: Next.js 15+ with App Router & Turbopack
Language: TypeScript with strict typing
Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
Authentication: Supabase Auth (email/password + magic links)
UI Framework: React 19 with shadcn/ui components
Styling: Tailwind CSS 4 with dark mode support
Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
State Management: React Context (CartProvider)
Icons: Lucide React

Core Business Logic

1. Data Entities
Ingredients: Raw materials with cost per unit
Meals: Dishes composed of ingredients (with optional price overrides)
Packets: Bundles of meals (catering packages)
Carts: Shopping carts with draft/final status
Cart Items: Individual items in cart with custom markup percentages

2. Pricing Engine (app/lib/pricing.ts)
Meal Net Price: Sum of (ingredient cost × quantity)
Meal Gross Price: Net price × (1 + markup %)
Packet Pricing: Aggregates meal costs
Cart Summary: Totals with average markup calculations

3. Key Features
Dashboard Management (/dashboard/*)
Ingredients: CRUD with name, unit, net price
Meals: CRUD with description, price overrides
Packets: CRUD for meal bundles
Consistent UI patterns with data tables, forms, and delete confirmations

Shopping Cart System (/cart)
Real-time search for meals/packets
Add items with custom markup percentages
Edit markup on existing items
Cart finalization (converts draft → final, creates new draft)
Comprehensive pricing summaries

Authentication Flow
Email/password login (/login)
Magic link authentication option
Email confirmation handling
Protected routes via middleware
User profile management

Architecture Patterns

Server Actions (app/actions/)
Type-safe CRUD operations
Supabase admin client for bypassing RLS
Consistent error handling and validation
Path revalidation for cache busting

Component Structure
Page Components: Server components for data fetching
Client Components: Interactive UI with "use client"
Provider Pattern: CartProvider for global cart state
Dialog System: Modal forms for CRUD operations

Database Integration
Row Level Security: User-scoped data access
Service Role: Admin operations via server actions
Type Generation: Database types from Supabase CLI
Real-time: Potential for live updates (infrastructure ready)

Form Handling
Zod schemas for validation
React Hook Form for state management
Consistent error handling
Type-safe form submissions

Key Business Workflows
Cost Management: Ingredients → Meals → Packets (hierarchical costing)
Price Calculation: Net costs + markup % = gross pricing
Cart Operations: Search → Add → Markup → Finalize
User Journey: Login → Dashboard Management → Cart Creation → Finalization

Development Status
Core Features: Fully implemented and functional
UI/UX: Professional, consistent design system
Data Layer: Robust with proper validation
Authentication: Complete with multiple flows
Missing: Main dashboard landing page, user registration UI

Notable Implementation Details
Server-side rendering with client-side interactivity
Optimistic UI updates with proper error handling
Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
Professional-grade form validation
Responsive design with dark mode support

This codebase represents a production-ready application with enterprise-level architecture patterns and could easily scale to support multi-tenant scenarios or additional business features.
